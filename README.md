# Chordster (v2)

Chordster is a simple web-app that allows users to upload chords for songs, and access songs submitted by other users. This is the ideal app for musicians who want to play along to songs, or analyse their chord structures.

## Work in Progress

Updating Chordster application to use microservice architecture rather than monolithic and other design patterns I've recently learnt.

original version: [Chordster](https://github.com/Bransonlj/chordster)
